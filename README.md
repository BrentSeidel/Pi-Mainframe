# Pi-Mainframe
Simulated mainframe computer based on a Raspberry Pi

When I was a young lad, computers had complicated panels filled with
switches and lights.  Sadly, these disappeared as I got older.

This project is an attempt to recreate the feel of old mainframe computers
using a Raspberry Pi 3 and some other assorted parts that I had laying
around.  The actual boxes and panels are 3D printed.

This is still very much a work in progress and things will change.
